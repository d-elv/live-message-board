IMPLEMENT STORAGE
Implement Firebase Storage which stores users profile photos during login
this can then be used in the userPresence component.

PROFILE PAGE
Create Profile Page where users can see their own info
On this page they will be able to upload their own profile photos

Choose a Storage Solution:
Decide where you want to store the custom profile photos. Common options include cloud storage services like Firebase Storage, Amazon S3, or a server file system. Ensure that the chosen solution supports public access to the images or implement the necessary authentication mechanisms.

Provide Default Stock Photos:
You can have a set of default stock photos that users can choose from if they don't upload their own. These can be stored in your application or retrieved from an external source.

User Upload:
Implement a feature that allows users to upload custom profile photos. You can use input elements of type file in HTML and handle the file upload in your backend server or directly with a cloud storage service.

Example HTML:

html
Copy code
<input type="file" accept="image/*" id="profilePhotoInput" />
Image Processing (Optional):
Depending on your requirements, you might want to implement image processing to resize or crop user-uploaded images to a specific size or aspect ratio.

Store Images:
When a user uploads a custom profile photo, store it in the chosen storage solution. Make sure to organize your storage so that each user's photos are separate.

Update User Profile:
Link the user's profile to their chosen profile photo. This can be done by storing the image URL or file path in your user database.

Display Profile Photos:
When displaying user profiles, check if a user has a custom profile photo. If they do, display the custom photo; otherwise, display the default stock photo.

Example:

html
Copy code
<img src="{userProfilePhotoURL}" alt="Profile Photo" />
Editing and Removing Photos:
Implement features to allow users to edit or remove their profile photos. This can involve updating the stored photo or deleting it from the storage.

Security Considerations:
Ensure that your storage solution and application handle user-uploaded content securely. Validate and sanitize user inputs, and be aware of potential security risks associated with file uploads.
